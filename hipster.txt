And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. (C.A.R. Hoare) To err is human, but to really foul things up you need a computer. (Paul Ehrlich) Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live. (Martin Golding) There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home. (Ken Olson, President, Digital Equipment Corporation, 1977)
